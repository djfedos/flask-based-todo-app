# Tasker Quick Start Tutorial

## Getting started

First install Tasker according to [the instructions](https://taskfile.dev/installation) from the official site. I use [the Install Script](https://taskfile.dev/installation/#install-script) and it works just fine.

To create a new taskfile in the directory run a command:  
`task â€“init`  
A new file, Taskfile.yaml, will appear. Open this file in any text editor. It content will look like this:

```
# https://taskfile.dev

version: '3'

vars:
  GREETING: Hello, World!

tasks:
  default:
    cmds:
      - echo "{{.GREETING}}"
    silent: true
```

If you'll run a command `task` with no arguments, Tasker will run the `deafult` task,
hence it's name.

To make your own task, type it below the exisiting one. Mind indentations, so that task name shold be indented the same amount as the `default` task name and so on. The result should look like this:


```
# https://taskfile.dev

version: '3'

vars:
  GREETING: Hello, World!

tasks:
  default:
    cmds:
      - echo "{{.GREETING}}"
    silent: true

  first-task:
    cmds:
      - echo "My first task runs fine"
```
Now try running `task first-task`. It should execute the command that you have written in `cmds` section.

So far so good. Now let's add the description to our task. First it's a good practice to know what the task's doing. Also, even if the task is self-explanatory, a description allows Tasker shell completion to work. For simple tasks like this simply add a dummy `desc: _` line:

```
  first-task:
    desc: _
    cmds:
      - echo "My first task runs fine"
```
